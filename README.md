# MemoryDumper

MemoryDumper is a tool to create an encrypted memory dump of the lsass.exe process and then decrypt it offline to retrieve password hashes. The project consists of two parts: `MemoryDumper.cpp`, which creates the encrypted memory dump, and `Decrypt.cpp`, which decrypts the encrypted dump file.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio (or another C++ compiler)
- Crypto++ library

## How to compile

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Install the Crypto++ library: https://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Visual_Studio
3. Create a new Visual Studio project and add the `MemoryDumper.cpp` and `Decrypt.cpp` files.
4. Set up the project to use the Crypto++ library.
5. Compile the project.

## Usage

1. Run the compiled MemoryDumper.exe with administrative privileges to create an encrypted memory dump of the lsass.exe process. The encrypted dump file will be saved as `encrypted_lsass.dmp` in the C:\Windows\tasks\ directory.

2. To decrypt the encrypted memory dump, run the compiled Decrypt.exe and provide the path to the encrypted dump file as a command-line argument. The decrypted memory dump will be saved as `decrypted.dmp` in the same directory as Decrypt.exe.

## How It Works

### MemoryDumper.cpp

1. The program starts by enabling the `SeDebugPrivilege` and checking if it's running as an elevated process. This is necessary to access the lsass.exe process and dump its memory.

2. It creates a new file named `lsass.dmp` in the C:\Windows\tasks\ directory to store the memory dump.

3. The program searches for the lsass.exe process and retrieves its process ID.

4. It opens a handle to the lsass.exe process with `PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS` permission.

5. The program loads the `Dbghelp.dll` library and retrieves the `MiniDumpWriteDump` function address.

6. The `MiniDumpWriteDump` function is called with the lsass.exe process handle, process ID, and dump file handle, which creates a full memory dump of the lsass.exe process.

7. After creating the memory dump, the program encrypts it using the `EncFile` function, which utilizes the AES encryption algorithm with CBC mode. The encrypted dump is saved as `encrypted_lsass.dmp` in the C:\Windows\tasks\ directory.

8. The original, unencrypted memory dump (`lsass.dmp`) is deleted.

### Decrypt.cpp

1. The program starts by checking if an input file is provided as a command-line argument. If not, it prints an error message and exits.

2. It retrieves the wide command-line arguments using `CommandLineToArgvW` function.

3. The key and initialization vector (IV) used for AES decryption are defined in the source code. These values should match the ones used in the MemoryDumper.cpp for encryption.

4. The `Decrypt` function is called with the input file path, key, and IV. It reads the encrypted input file and decrypts it using the AES decryption algorithm with CBC mode. The decrypted data is written to a new file named `decrypted.dmp`.

5. The memory allocated by `CommandLineToArgvW` is freed, and the program exits.

The MemoryDumper and Decrypt programs work together to create an encrypted memory dump of the lsass.exe process and then decrypt it for further analysis. The encryption and decryption processes use the AES algorithm with CBC mode to ensure the confidentiality of the memory dump.
